      <description>End of university Finally it ended, I changed university 3 times :)  Studied one semester in Innopolis University - it was very free, but useless time. After that I back to Kazan Federal University, where started studying. Can&amp;rsquo;t say that it was better, but I could work fulltime :) I remember only as my faculty took 2nd place on mini-footbal championat, it was all of a sudden, we were outsiders of the group.</description>
